# Dalebot
A Discord bot which interfaces Discord messages with Stable Diffusion

![](examplepic.png)

## Features
- Type "!dale help" to get a list of supported arguments
- txt2img
- img2img
- upscale
- specify the seed
- set prompt conformity
- specify the number of samples
- negative prompts
- specify the number of images you'd like it to return
- specify the resolution
- specify denoising
- reply to a dalepost with "!dale" and more prompts, and dale will append those prompts onto the previous prompt(s)
- react to a dalepost with "ðŸŽ²" to reroll the same prompt with a different seed

## Requirements
- This isn't the AI. This is simply a bot that reads discord messages, feeds them into the AI, and returns the generated images back to discord.
- You MUST BE RUNNING the [Stable Diffusion AI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) locally at http://127.0.0.1:7860/.
- I'm using Python 3.10.7. Other versions of Python 3 may work, but I've only tested it on this version.
- Use [this guide](https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2022/05/05/create-a-discord-bot-in-python/) to set up a discord bot if you don't know how.
	- Make sure the bot has permissions to:
		- Read Messages/View Channels
		- Send Messages
		- Send Messages in Threads
		- Embed Links
		- Attach Files
		- Add Reactions
		- Possibly others that I'm forgetting
	- You can stop following the linked guide when you get to the step where they're editing mc_discord_bot.py
- Clone this repository locally
- Generate and copy an OAuth2 Token for your bot. Create a text file in the repository called ".env". Its contents should look like this:
	- ![](envfile.png)
- Required python libraries (I installed with pip):
	- discord
	- python-dotenv
	- requests
	- pybase64
	- pillow
- Run the bot by typing "python bot.py" in the repository directory


If you're able to start the bot running, and the bot is able to see discord messages, but you still get an error, it may be a problem I'm unable to fix. The Stable Diffusion webui updates the format of the json payload ocassionally. I'm unable to get this format dynamically; I can only set these indices manually. I've asked for help with this [here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/discussions/2108), but as of right now I don't have a solution.
